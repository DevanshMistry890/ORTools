# ORTools
Getting Started with Google OR Tools

OR-Tools is open source software for combinatorial optimization, which seeks to find the best solution to a problem out of a very large set of possible solutions. 
In most cases, problems like these have a vast number of possible solutionsâ€”too many for a computer to search them all. To overcome this, OR-Tools uses state-of-the-art algorithms to narrow down the search set, to find an optimal (or close to optimal) solution.

This repository is my tutorial work for it.
